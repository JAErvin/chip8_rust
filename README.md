# chip8_rust

A chip-8 emulator that uses sdl2.
Just a little play-thing to give me an excuse to learn rust.





Still a ton of refactoring to do, some graphical updates needed (resizing, color selection,...), extensions added (HiRes, SChip-8,...), etc.
Seems to play roms just fine as far as I can tell with my very limited play-testing.

Thanks to [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) and misc. random reddit posts.

I don't really care about documenting design decisions here at the moment, maybe later.... hey, why are you even reading this?
